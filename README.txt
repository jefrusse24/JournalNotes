Description
This program is a cross between a journal and a notebook.  It is used to keep track of thoughts or ideas you have during the day.  You can copy and paste text in the notebook, create a list of to-do items, or just enter your thoughts.  Each page gives you a fresh place to start.  You can search through the pages if you like, or do many other things.
