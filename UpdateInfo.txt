Database Read
It will first look at the local File Copy, and read the last Modified Date
Then read the Database Last Modified Date and the by Who (UUID) value.
If they are the same, then just read the local file copy.
If they are different, then :

  If the database date is newer, then we need to get every page from the DB that has a modified
  date that is after the local file copies modified date.
  
  If the Local File ise newer, then we need to send every page from the local file that has a modified
  date that is after the DB modified date.  We also need to update the modified date and the UUID field.
  
  
  What if there is a conflict?  How do you detect a conflict?
  Page on DB modified by user1 is newer than local copy (User 2)?  You need to keep track of the last time
  the page was synched with the DB (Sort of like a version number).
  
Document:
  Date Last Synched
  Date Last Modified
  
Page:
  Date Created
  Date Last Synched
  Date Modified
  
The database modified and last sync are the same value.  Only need one field in the DB.
  
When attempting to sync with DB, we get the Last Synched Date from local and db.  If the uuid and sync date are the same, then
everything is fine.  Use the local file copy.

If the uuid is the same and the modified dates are different, (the last modified has to be more recent on the local)
then use the local file copy and send updates to the DB.
  Updates are any page that has a modified date > than sync date.

If the uuids are different, then we look at each page as we try to reconsile the differences.  Our goal is to get
the local and db to the latest.
  - If local last sync == db last sync, do nothing.  (both the same)
  - If local last sync < db last sync
    - if local last sync == local modified, get db page to local
    - if local last sync != local modified, CONFLICT
  - If local last sync > db last sync - CANT HAPPEN.
  
This may occur if the last time we were working on the document, we could not sync with DB
  - If local modified > local last sync
    - if db last sync == local last sync, send local page to db
	- if db last sync > local last sync, CONFLICT
	- if db last sync < local last sync - CANT HAPPEN

  - When you read in a document, select the last page to be shown in the page panel and the summary panel.
  - Got the "New" button and the menu item "New Page" to work correctly.
