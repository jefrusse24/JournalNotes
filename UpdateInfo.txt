====================================
Things to do:
+ Text Size Modification (MInputField - use JTextPane instead of JTextArea???)
+ Display a pages tags somewhere/somehow.
+ If you create a solid shape, then go to edit a non-solid shape, the non-solid shape
  becomes solid.
+ Should not be able to change the "Root" node of the tag list with Edit->Update Tags...
+ Toolbar and menu items need to be aware of eachother.  If you select the Ellipse in
  the menubar, then the ellipse should get hilighted in the toolbar.
+ Menubar.  Do not do the "Unselect" type action - where if Rectangle is selected, and
  you select rectangle it goes back to the default of "text" mode.  Instead just leave
  it in Rectangle mode.
+ Need to be able to remove tags from a page.
+ Set the master password for the document.
+ Allow lines to have length on them or not - Shape parameter.
+ After editing a shape, make sure you keep the shapes (DONE: original color, text,) line width, solid value.
+ If there is a backup file, ask the use if they want to restore from the backup.

Somethig wrong with the 00 00 78 at 0x24add
The 2e is a period for the last sentence.  Then the 00 00 is the start of an object (ImageBlock)
but the reader does not read it correctly.... not sure why, or what it is expecting.
So a way around it is to read in the correct number of bytes and jsut put in an empty object in the array.
The other is to skip the whole page.

*****************
*** FORMATTED TEXT
*****************
Need to be able to keep this formatting on each page.
Each Page needs to have a StyledDocument object.
If this object is not null, then we will use it.
This will contain the text as well as the formatting.
In the Page class, we have a variable DOCUMENT_VERSION that will
be embedded in each page that will indicate what version this page
is.  A StyledDocument needs to be saved in each page.  How do you
get a unique SytledDocument into each page?  

PAGE FORMAT:  (Version 0-99)
  integer - page number
  UTF String - Page Title
  integer - page type
  long - date
  Color - page color
  LinkedList - Page Objects
  UTF String - Categories
  UTF String - PageLockKey
  
PAGE FORMAT:  (Version 150)
  integer - page number
  UTF String - Page Title
  integer - Version (150)
  integer - page type
  long - date
  Color - page color
  LinkedList - Page Objects
  UTF String - Categories
  UTF String - PageLockKey
  LinkedList - FormatEntryList
  UTF String - Page Text    

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
March 20, 2013
   Made changes to handle the different font styles.
   NoteMenuBar - List the styles, and handle the styles selected.  New ENUM class for the styles. 
   Page - Changes to handle the reading/writing and also the styled document object and its new things.
   FormatEntry - New Class for the formatting
   FormatEntryList - New class for the formatting.  Contais a list of FormatEntry.  This is to be saved in the doc.
   AScrollPanel - Changes here too.
 
I Don't think we need the KelListener in the AScrollPanel, because there is a class inside AScrollPanel for that,
but there is some code in the current listeners (that I don't think get touched), but perhaps this functionality is
now missing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
March 23, 2013
+ Get Find... working again after changing to a Styled Text.
  AScrollPanel, Page
+ Get Copy/Paste working for formatted text.
  - JTextPaneSelection, JTextPaneTransferHandler - New Files
